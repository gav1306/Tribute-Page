        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>
          BTS, an acronym of Bangtan Sonyeondan or “Beyond the Scene,” is a
          Grammy-nominated South Korean group that has been capturing the hearts
          of millions of fans globally since its debut in June 2013. The members
          of BTS are RM, Jin, SUGA, j-hope, Jimin, V, and Jung Kook.
        </p>

          Their single "Butter" started trending all over TikTok, while hits
          like "Dynamite", "Boy With Luv" (feat Halsey) and "Mic Drop" (feat
          Steve Aoki) shattered the charts and are immediately recognized by the
          crowds all over the world. Among several Billboard music awards, Asian
          music awards and many others, BTS have collected a jaw-dropping 23
          Guinness World Records titles across music and social media – an
          amazing result achieved also thanks to the enthusiasm of their fans,
          the ARMY.

          Today, they are the most streamed group on Spotify (beating the
          British band Coldplay) and the most followed music group on Instagram.
          As for the blue bird app, BTS’ official accounts snatched the most
          Twitter engagements (average retweets) for a music group (a record
          that they have topped four times!). Their May 2021 release, "Butter",
          single-handedly snatched five records, among which we find most
          viewers for the premiere of a music video on YouTube (previously held
          by BTS’ success “Dynamite”) and most streamed track on Spotify in the
          first 24 hours.
